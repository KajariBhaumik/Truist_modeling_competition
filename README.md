# Truist_modeling_competition

### Problem Statement
In this machine learning competition, you will be challenged with a compelling binary classification problem: predicting whether a client will enroll in a Certificate of Deposit (CD) or not. Your task is to create an algorithm that can make this prediction with high accuracy and efficiency, which in turn will optimize our marketing efforts and streamline our approach towards potential clients. The target variable is binary, classified as '1' if the client has enrolled in a CD, and '0' otherwise.
